# Web History

Sometimes you don't want the browser tracking history when you navigate. In that
case, go_router supports
[Router.neglect](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router/neglect.html).

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  // turn off history tracking in the browser for this navigation
  onPressed: () => Router.neglect(context, () => context.go('/page2'))},
  ...
),
```

The use of `Router.neglect` will stop the Flutter router from adding this page
to the browser history. If you'd like the browser to stop tracking history
altogether for your app, set the `routerNeglect` parameter of the `GoRouter`
constructor. This will suppress history for all navigation made using go_router.

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  // turn off history tracking in the browser for all navigation
  routerNeglect: true,
  ...
);
```

Even when you ask the router to neglect to add navigation to the brower's
history, deep and dynamic linking will continue to work and the brower's address
bar will update as you navigate through your app. It's only the browser's Back
button that will be affected.
